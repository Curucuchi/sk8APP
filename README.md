The point of this project is for me to learn and practice connecting to SQL, and querying data. Try to use CRUD

But also a fun project for me to make a skate app on CLI that will recommend me random tricks to go try, and a random skatepark to go skate. I  might add an ability to log in...

Also consume APIs for no good reason

Also may add a trick wish list that I can add tricks to that will update sql and add tricks that are on my bucket list. Mostly to practice updating data.
